The game contains 4 main scenes (main, enemy, player, heads up). As the main scene’s code executes, you’ll see a label containing the objective of the game (dodge the aliens) and the start button. By pressing this button, a good alien (you) spawns at the center of the screen and moves using the WASD keys. After a specific timer time out, bad aliens (enemies) spawn at pseudo-random parts of the screen’s border. The point of the game is to avoid colliding with the enemies. As you continue avoiding them your score gets increased by 1 each second. The moment you collide with one, the game is over, and the score is reset to 0. And then you’re given another chance to beat your last high score and keep dodging the aliens by pressing the “play again” button.
